## 🧠 The Only True Weed Fact (Connoisseur Verified)

- ✅ **Weed science is not permanent.** It changes with time, tech, and testing.  
- ✅ **Every user, scientist, and stoner is guessing.** Some guesses are better than others.  
- ✅ **Until weed science holds for 2 generations, all claims are temporary.** Then we delete and re-research.  
- ✅ This is the only real fact about weed. Everything else is just current best guesses.  
- ✅ This guide includes:
  - Proven facts (marked ✅)  
  - Unproven but highly speculated info (marked ⚠️)  
  - Stoner knowledge that matched science later (marked 🧓)  
  - Anything not here is either unknown or hasn’t earned a spot yet

## 🔬 What’s in Weed Besides THC and CBD?

| Compound | What It Does | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| THC | Gets you high, pain relief, appetite boost | ✅ Verified |
| CBD | Calms anxiety, no high | ✅ Verified |
| CBN | Sleepy, mild psychoactive (from old THC) | ✅ Verified |
| THCA | “Baby THC,” medical effects without high | ⚠️ Needs more research |
| CBG, CBC, CBDV, THCV | Unique effects (anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, etc.) | ⚠️ Early studies only |

## 🌈 Terpenes: The Smell That Changes the High

| Terpene | Smell | Effects | Burn Temp |
|--------|-------|---------|------------|
| Linalool | Lavender | Relaxing, sedative | ~198°C |
| Limonene | Citrus | Uplifting, anti-anxiety | ~176°C |
| Myrcene | Earthy | Sedative, muscle relaxant | ~167°C |
| Pinene | Pine | Alertness, memory boost | ~155°C |
| Caryophyllene | Pepper | Anti-inflammatory | ~130°C |

🔥 If you burn weed past ~230°C, it releases benzene, formaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide.  
Some say it fogs your brain. Others say it clears it. Depends on the person and the strain.  
✅ Vape users: To activate all terpenes, stay between **130°C and 198°C**.

## 🧬 Entourage Effect: Myth vs Fact

- Weed works better when all parts are together.  
- THC + terpenes + flavonoids = stronger, smarter high.  
- 🧓 Stoners said it first. Science caught up.  
- ✅ Some terpenes boost THC’s effect (synergy), others calm it down (antagonism).  
- ⚠️ Still being researched. Not fully proven.

## 🧪 Trichomes: The Crystal Factory

- Trichomes = tiny mushroom-shaped glands on the flower.  
- They make cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and maybe keystone molecules.  
- ⚠️ Scientists are still decoding their full molecular structure.
